Coding develops problem-solving skills
Through coding, children learn to quickly fix and try again in different ways when something
doesn't work out. Coding also equips kids with the ability to stick with a problem and work
on finding a solution. This problem-solving technique is transferable to a lot of other 
fields. Coding teaches kids how to break down complex ideas and arrange them in a way that computers 
can understand. Communication is an absolutely essential skill throughout school, work, and 
life in general. People who can clearly communicate complex ideas in simple terms tend to be 
more successful in all walks of life.

Coding can help you improve your logical thinking skills by allowing you to see problems 
from a new perspective. Complex coding projects are made up of smaller tasks and by breaking
down the problem and adopting a methodological way of thinking, you can tackle any challenge.

One purpose of coding is to transform the data into a form suitable for computer-aided 
analysis. This categorization of information is an important step, for example, in preparing
data for computer processing with statistical software.</font>
